- conversation:  what File metadata carries through into record

- conversation:  what is the root element, if XML <book/> is JSON contain "book" or is that the root,
                 if is element then allows room for other metadata

- conversation:  where does primary key come from (i.e. RS =>  `$.fileInfo/filename`)

- conversation:  flush out simple mapping instructions JSON w/Ashleigh and team

- conversation:  text element name "value", do we need to mark with special char?
                 attribute prefix <none> (@ conflicts with JSONPath), do we need to retain fact of attr?
                 with a different char, i.e. "#"

- conversation:  JSON-LD context, we should reference shared one (URI), and have all fields mapped there to
                 their schema type

- conversation:  lookup files, how to handle

- Reset root to not be array

- Direct XML parsing, to drop Data Parser component (it breaks the root element)

- during direct XML parsing, retain embedded XHTML tags

- mapping instruction validate and error reporting to UI

- add instructions:
      - unwrap
           - unarray field that is single value
           - unmap field that is single key
           - child value becomes parent if no other fields present (something:[value:123] = something:123)

- fix build annotation processing for StreamSets .properties files so not hand created

- Document simple mapping instruction format

- Document JSONPath target `@..bla` format vs. '$.other.item[0].that.overlaps.source.path'

- Other manipulations from SLS, prioritized by people performing mappings

- support SLS mapping instruction JSON format, if needed

- check performance at scale
